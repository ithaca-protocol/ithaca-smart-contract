# ERC1967Proxy







*This contract implements an upgradeable proxy. It is upgradeable because calls are delegated to an implementation address that can be changed. This address is stored in storage in the location specified by https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967[EIP1967], so that it doesn&#39;t conflict with the storage layout of the implementation behind the proxy.*


## Events

### Upgraded

```solidity
event Upgraded(address indexed implementation)
```



*Emitted when the implementation is upgraded.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| implementation `indexed` | address | undefined |



## Errors

### AddressEmptyCode

```solidity
error AddressEmptyCode(address target)
```



*There&#39;s no code at `target` (it is not a contract).*

#### Parameters

### ERC1967InvalidImplementation

```solidity
error ERC1967InvalidImplementation(address implementation)

*The `implementation` of the proxy is invalid.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |

### ERC1967NonPayable

```solidity
error ERC1967NonPayable()
